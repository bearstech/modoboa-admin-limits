   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to modoboa-admin-limits's documentation!
================================================

This extension offers a way to define limits about how many objects
(aliases, mailboxes) a domain administrator can create.

It also brings a new administrative role: ``Reseller``. A reseller is a domain
administrator that can also manipulate domains and assign permissions
to domain administrators.

If you don't want to limit a particular object type, just set the
associated value to -1.

Default limits applied to new administrators can be changed through
the *Modoboa > Parameters > Limits* page.
